Author: Z. Belcheva

-> __Clone__ repository into local folder;

-> __Run__ the file _run.sh_

-> __Output__:
 1. _output_ folder contains .txt files for the output of every exercise.
 2. _plots_ folder contains all produced plots.
 3. _report.pdf_ is a written document containing the scripts, output, figures, comments and descriptions on the worked problems.


__Note:__ Due to unforeseen circumstances (i.e. train strike) I am unable to test this directly on a STRW computer today (28.05), and working over SSH gives Display Environment errors that don't allow my plots to save. However, two people have confirmed for me that in principle it should work on computers in the HL, and run for under 10 minutes. I hope that when you run it, the plots directory does not end up empty :( the scripts themselves work perfectly for me on their own, and under the time limit.
